# RPG Maker MZ Mods Client

[Инструкция на русском языке](https://github.com/FaetterP/RMMZ-mods-client/blob/main/readme-rus.md)

Allows installing multiple mods for games made with RPG Maker MZ.

A mod here can refer to either a single modified file or the entire modified version of the game.  
For example, if a mod changes only one specific dialogue, it's enough to save just that file.  
The mod author may also provide the entire game, in which case it will also be recognized as a mod.

## Installation

1) Download the client and place all files into the game's folder. Make sure to replace all existing files.  
You can download the client by clicking the `Code → Download ZIP` button.

2) Place the mods inside the `mods` folder. For reference, a `test-mod` is included as an example.
3) If everything is done correctly, a mod loading screen will appear when launching the game.

Mods may conflict with each other if they modify the same events. In this case, an error message will be displayed.

Mods are reapplied every time the game is launched, so they can be added or removed as needed.  
*Just like in Minecraft, for example.*
